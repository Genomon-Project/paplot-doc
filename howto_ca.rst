CA graph
==============

| On the CA (Chromosomal Aberration) graph, we visualize mutations between Chromosome, such as Structural Variation (SV), with circular plot and display its distribution with bar graph.
|

* In the bar graph, we display the total number of breakpoints in all samples.
* In the circular plot, breakpoints 1 and 2 are displayed with a line for each sample.

| When a bar graph is selected, a sample with a breakpoint in the selected genome area is selected.
| There are two selection methods, "Highlight" and "Show only selected items (Hide others)", which can be selected with the first option button.

| There are two stacks in the bar chart, and the color is separated depending on whether two break points are beyond the chromosome or within the same chromosome.
| If unchecked, that element is not displayed.

| Show the details by hovering the mouse over the line connecting the breakpoint.
