CA plot
==============

| In the CA (Chromosomal Aberration such as ) plot, a landscape of chromosomal aberrations such as structural variations (typically identified by genome sequence data) and gene fusions (by transcriptome sequence data) are represented.

* Barplot at the top panel shows the frequency of breakpoints of CAs aggregated  plot, the total number of breakpoints of CAs in all samples 
* The circular plots below shows the [CIRCOS-like](http://circos.ca) profile of CAs for each sample, where two edges of a curved line represent breakpoints of each CA.

| When you select a region in the barplot at the top, samples having any of the breakpoints in the selected region are highlighted. 
| The checkbox (Style of selected graphs) adjust how the highlight is displayed.

| There are two stacks in the bar chart, and the color is separated depending on whether two break points are beyond the chromosome or within the same chromosome.
| If unchecked, that element is not displayed.
